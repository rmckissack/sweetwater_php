James McKissack PHP demo


I have completed the coding.
There was a change I had to make to the sql file in order for it to create and populate the table correctly. 
It had to do with the 0000-00-00 date and strict mode.

There are several things I would like to have done differently but didn't take the time to investigate exactly how to set it up.
One big thing is where I check for expected ship date. I really wish I could have done this using regular expression and 
be able to read through the entire comment string to extract the date. The way I coded it the date had to be at the end of the comment string.

Thank you for this oppertunity and I hope you have a great day
